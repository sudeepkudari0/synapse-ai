## ✨ Features

- 🎤 **Offline Speech Recognition** - Real-time, 100% local transcription using Whisper.cpp or Moonshine ONNX pipelines, keeping all speech data completely private.
- 🧠 **AI-Powered Answer Feedback** - Get structured answer suggestions and guidance using local LLMs (via Ollama) or cloud providers (OpenAI SDK).
- 📊 **Real-Time Delivery Analytics** - Keep track of pacing (words per minute), filler words (like "um", "ah", "like"), and talk-time ratios to improve your delivery flow.
- 📝 **Resume-Aware Feedback** - Input your professional background summary to receive personalized answer suggestions tailored specifically to your unique experience.
- ⭐ **STAR Method Suggestions** - Practice structuring your behavioral responses using the Situation, Task, Action, and Result (STAR) framework.
- 📄 **Practice Session Scoring & PDF Export** - Review multi-dimensional scores for your answers and export complete practice session reports to PDF for offline review.
- 💼 **Career Hub** - Search for active job listings across top platforms and prepare specifically for those roles by importing their job descriptions directly into practice sessions.

- **Build & Package Tooling:** [Vite](https://vite.dev/), [electron-builder](https://www.electron.build/)
- **UI Design System:** [Tailwind CSS](https://tailwindcss.com/), [shadcn/ui](https://ui.shadcn.com/)
- **Speech-to-Text Engines:** [Whisper.cpp](https://github.com/ggerganov/whisper.cpp), Moonshine ONNX
- **LLM Integrations:** [Ollama](https://ollama.com/) (Local), OpenAI SDK (Cloud)
- **PDF Generation:** `jspdf`

---

## 🚀 Getting Started

### Prerequisites

- [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/) (v18+) or [Bun](https://bun.sh/)
- Windows OS (Required for transparent overlay features and desktop audio loopback capture)
- [Ollama](https://ollama.com/) (Required for local LLM execution)

### Installation

Clone the repository and install dependencies:

```bash
# Clone the repository
git clone https://github.com/sudeepkudari0/synapse-ai.git
cd synapse-ai

# Install dependencies using bun (or npm)
bun install
```

### Running Locally

```bash
# Build the Electron main and preload processes
bun run build:electron

# Start the application in development mode
bun run dev
```

### 🧠 Setting up AI Models

1. **Speech Recognition (STT):**
   Model files can be downloaded directly from the Settings Panel inside the application. The system manages downloading and switching between Whisper and Moonshine engines automatically.
   
2. **Local LLM Answers (Ollama):**
   Ensure Ollama is running on your machine. Pull your preferred model (e.g., `qwen2.5-coder:7b` or `llama3.1:8b`):
   ```bash
   ollama run qwen2.5-coder:7b
   ```

## 🧪 Testing

Synapse AI uses [Playwright](https://playwright.dev/) for end-to-end integration and smoke tests.

```bash
# Run all E2E tests
bun run test:e2e

# Run tests with a visible window (headed)
bun run test:e2e:headed

# Run tests in interactive UI mode
bun run test:e2e:ui
```

## 🏗️ Architecture

### Main Process (Electron)
- **STT Sidecar Integrations:** Manages native Whisper.cpp execution and Moonshine ONNX pipelines.
- **Window Management:** Configures practice overlay panels, resizing, position preservation, and desktop screen sharing.
- **IPC Handler Layer:** Handles type-safe, asynchronous calls from the React UI to retrieve/save settings, control windows, and execute system commands.

### Renderer Process (React)
- **Component Architecture:** Modern dashboard views (Overview, Career Hub, Settings) and a transparent Practice overlay widget.
- **Custom React Hooks:** `useWhisper`, `useMixedAudioRecorder`, and `useLLM` wrap side-effects and provide cleaner state consumption.
- **Local Storage / Settings:** Saves user configurations, resume context, and saved job descriptions securely on-device.
